## URL Structure
```
sprout-sync.vercel.app/u/jessica/ficus-lyra
                         â”‚        â”‚
                         â”‚        â””â”€ Plant slug (auto-generated, editable)
                         â””â”€ Username (from first name, editable)
```

## Health Score Logic
```
Starting score: 100
For each active task:
  - If task is overdue:
    - Subtract 1 point per day overdue
Minimum score: 0
```

## Care Streak Logic
```
Look back from today:
- Check if ALL active tasks due each day were completed on time
- Count consecutive days of perfect care
- Stop when hitting a day with missed/late tasks
- Minimum streak: 1 (for having the plant)
```
